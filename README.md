### Python script that prints the tic-tac-toe game on the console.

 This is code written in python to simulate tic-tac-toe.  The code is error-handled and stops execution only when requested (by typing 'exit' at any time) or after 5 rounds, a number that can be changed.  A scoreboard is also shown on the screen that counts the number of victories and presents the winner at the end of the code execution.
<br/>
The game starts asking for the name of player 1 and the choice of "X" or "O", then the name of player 2. then it prints the board on the screen and asks player 1 to choose column "a", "b " or "c" and then the line "1", "2", or "3" and then prints the board again with the player's symbol in the chosen place and then goes to player 2. The player who completes a sequence of 3 symbols vertically, horizontally or diagonally wins the game and starts the next game.  Players can type "exit" at any time to end the game, if any value is typed wrong the game informs and asks to type again.
